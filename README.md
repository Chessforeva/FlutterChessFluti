# FlutiChess

A simple flutter chess playing application developed in flutter.
There are two old chess engines ported to .dart language.
Kind of experimental exploration of flutter on MS vscode.
Everything is shareable and advancable anywhere.

# Version

Currently 1.0.8

There are bugs, I know them. Anyway it is playable on web

Also windows executable

I could not gradle on android, maybe in next versions.
IOS - not an Apple fanboy

# Results

Flutter is awesome.
Lousy chess engine requires 64 bit platform (not javascript VM). Bugs too.
OwlChess is oldie.
It is not stockfish, it is dart and flutter programming.

# Also...

There will be lots of flutter works after downloading sources.
Just read what people say and look at other flutter projects.

Alpha version for now.
