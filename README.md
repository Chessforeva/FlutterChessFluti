# FlutiChess

A simple flutter chess playing application developed in flutter.
There are two old chess engines ported to .dart language.
Kind of experimental exploration of flutter on MS vscode.
Everything is shareable and advancable anywhere.

# Results

Flutter is awesome.
Lousy chess engine requires 64 bit platform (not javascript VM).
OwlChess is an oldie for 32 bit platform.
It is not stockfish, it is dart and flutter programming.

# Also...

There will be lots of flutter works after downloading sources.
Just read what people say and look at other flutter projects.
Or add these folders to the flutter hello world.

Alpha version for now.
